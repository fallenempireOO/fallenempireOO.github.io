    <h1 style="color: white;"> <style="color:white;">ORIGIN/INFORMATION OF KARAMBIT </h1>



<p style="color: white;">The Karambit was, first and foremost, a tool of peace. it was originally an agricultural implement designed to rake roots, gather threshing and plant rice in most of island Southeast Asia. It's a smaller variant of the Southeast Asian sickles (Filipino garab and karit; Indonesian celurit, arit, or sabit; and Malaysian sabit). It still possesses many efficient uses for the modern laborer, allowing use of the blade for utility work, with the finger ring eliminating the need to put the knife down between operations, if use of the fingers to manipulate the object to be worked on is required (such as the action of cutting and opening a shipping box, or removing plastic wrap from shipments, in two very basic examples). The finger ring also provides an added degree of protection against dropping the knife during use, which is particularly essential in work environments that include heavy machinery, into which dropping a handheld, metal tool of any kind can cause massive damage to the equipment and those around it, especially if the tool is ejected at high velocity from rotating components. The karambit is believed to have originally been weaponized among the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra[2] where, according to folklore, it was inspired by the claws of a tiger. As it was weaponised, the blade became more curved to maximise cutting potential. Through Indonesia's trade network and close contact with neighbouring countries, the weaponization of the karambit was eventually dispersed through what are now Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines.[3][4]

Culturally, the karambit was a subject of condescension in Java because of its history as a weapon of the agrarian peasantry, as opposed to the kesatria (warrior class) who were trained in the keraton or royal palace. European accounts tell that soldiers in Indonesia were armed with a kris at their waist or back and a spear in their hands, while the karambit was used as a last resort when the fighter's other weapons were lost in battle. The renowned Bugis warriors of Sulawesi were famous for their embrace of the karambit. Today it is one of the main weapons of silat and is commonly used in Filipino martial arts as well.[5]

Superficially, the karambit resembles the jambiyah but there is no connection. The jambiyah was always designed as a weapon and serves as a status marker, often made by skilled artisans and jewelers using precious stones and metals, whereas the karambit was and still remains an unadorned, modest farmer's implement and useful utility knife</p>

     <h3 style="color: white;"> <style="font-size:40px;">CURVED DESIGN</h3>

        
        
        
         
    
     
     
    
    <p style="color:white;">No matter the design, though, a karambit will usually offer its user functionality straight blades cannot. The curved blade allows for easier cutting of difficult materials, better access to targets, and the ability to use unorthodox angles and approaches.</p>
    
     
    
    <h3 style="color:white;"> <style="font-size:40px;">VARIATION</h3>
    
    
    <p style="color:white;">There are many regional variants of karambit. The length of the blade, for example, could vary from one village or blacksmith to another. Some have no finger guard and some feature two blades, one on each side of the handle. Traditional types include:

Kuku Bima: Bhima's claw from West Java
Kuku Hanuman: Hanuman's claw from West Java
Kuku Macan: tiger's claw, endemic to Sumatra, Central Java and Madura
Kerambit Sumbawa: larger, sturdier kerambit made specially for battle. From the Sumba Islands
Kerambit Lombok: larger, sturdier kerambit made specially for battle. From Lombok
Lawi Ayam: chicken's claw, created by the Minang community
Additionally, modern karambit may have spikes or spurs on the front or rear ricasso, which may be intended for gripping clothing or horse tack, tearing flesh or for injecting a poison, such as the upas.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h3 style="color: white;"> <style="font-size:40px;">SELF DEFENSE</h3>
    
    
    
    <p style="color: white";>"While it is primarily used in a slashing or hooking motion, karambit with a finger ring are also used in a punching motion hitting the opponent with the finger ring. Some karambit are designed to be used in a hammering motion. This flexibility of striking methods is what makes it useful in self-defense situations.</p>
    
    
    
    <h3 style="color:white;"> <style="font-size:40px;">POPULARITY OF KARAMBIT</h3>
    
    
    
    <p style="color: white;">Karambit combat knives have become popular among modern martial artists mainly because of the increasing interest practitioners are showing in the Indonesian fighting arts and the subsequent proliferation of schools that teach them â€” thus, karambit combat knives have started finding their way into the mainstream.</p>
